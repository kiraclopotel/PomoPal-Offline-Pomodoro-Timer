# PomoPal-Offline-Pomodoro-Timer
PomoPal is a lightweight, privacy‑first Pomodoro timer implemented as a Chrome/Chromium extension. It replaces the now‑unavailable Marinara timer with a modern, customisable experience that never sends your data anywhere. All processing happens locally in your browser, so your productivity stats stay private.
